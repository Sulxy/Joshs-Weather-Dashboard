# Josh's Weather Dashboard

This Weather Dashboard is designed to display current weather data and the expected weather for the next 5 days of any given city. You can also use the current location button! 
It displays your recent searches in a growing list that allows you to remember what you searched, and go back and view those results again! 
Weather Results displayed: City, Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Temperature, Wind, Humidity, Feels-Like Temperature, and the Weather Pattern (Sunny, Scattered Clouds, Rain, etc).
